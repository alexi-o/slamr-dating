##What it is

Slamr is an online dating app geared towards incarcerated individuals. Being locked up doesn't mean that you need to be locked out of love.

To use the app, individuals are initially presented with a list of possible matches. To learn more about an individual, the user can click Read More and they will be taken to just that individual's "profile" which includes a few more details. Should the user find they are not interested, they can click Remove and that individual will be removed from the list.

On the main page, users can also use the search bar to search for individuals. 

##Technologies Used

MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, AngularJS, HTML, CSS, Node, Bootstrap
